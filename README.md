Analysis scripts and notebooks for network pharmacology and transcriptomic analyses of Polygonum cuspidatum (PC), including DEG preprocessing, enrichment analyses, and visualization.

# PC-network-pharmacology-transcriptomics

This repository contains analysis scripts and notebooks used in the study of
*Polygonum cuspidatum* (PC) to investigate its potential cardiometabolic and
immune-related mechanisms through network pharmacology and transcriptomic analyses.

## Associated manuscript
The code in this repository supports the analyses presented in the manuscript:
"Network pharmacology and transcriptomic integration reveals potential
cardiometabolic regulatory mechanisms of *Polygonum cuspidatum*."

## Data sources
Publicly available transcriptomic datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO), including GSE43292 and GSE20950. Differential expression analyses
were performed using GEO2R (limma-based), and full result tables were further
processed using custom Python scripts.

## Notes
This repository is under active development. Additional documentation,
parameter details, and processed result files will be added upon manuscript revision.
